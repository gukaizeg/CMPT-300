# CMPT 300 Assignment 4: System Calls

**Total points:** 100  
**Overall percentage:** 13%  
**Due:** Wed Apr 12, 23:59:59 PT

This assignment may be completed individually or in a group (up to three people).

**Note:** As usual, all code **must** be written in C and run on a Linux machine. We will grade your
code on a Linux machine. You should create a directory for this assignment, such as `~/cmpt300/a4/`
and put all files related to this assignment in it.

## Grouping

You can do the assignment as a group of up to 3 people if you'd like.Â If you do, make sure that
everyone joins the same team on GitHub Classroom. When you accept the invite for this assignment,
you can create a team if no one else in your team has created a team, or join an existing team.

## Note on Joining a Team on GitHub Classroom

Please make sure that you don't join a team without prior consent. **If that happens, it will be
considered cheating** as you can see the code that others have written.

## Git with Your Team

When you collaborate with others with Git, it is best to communicate with each other frequently in
order to avoid conflicts. For example, if you and your teammate edit the same part of the code and
push it to the remote GitHub repo, it will create a conflict. Cases like this require manual
merging, which is often difficult to get right. Thus, it is best to communicate with each other and
know which parts of the code others are working on.

Also, make sure you frequently pull the latest updates from your remote GitHub repo by running
`git pull`. Frequently doing this is very important.

Please follow the text below to understand the context, and attempt to finish the problems
described.

## Preparation

To complete this assignment, you must first complete the tasks in the following two documents:

* [Custom Kernel Guide](CUSTOM_KERNEL_GUIDE.md): how to download, build, and run a custom Linux
  kernel.
* [Guide to Linux System Calls](SYSCALL_GUIDE.md): how to create and test a simple Linux system
  call (syscall).
  
The tasks in the above documents require significant effort to complete. Make sure you start them
early. Without understanding the content in the above documents, you will not be able to complete
this assignment.

You *may* also consult the official [The Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.4/)
documentation for reference:

* [Unreliable Guide To Hacking The Linux
  Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.4/kernel-hacking/hacking.html?highlight=copy_to_user)
* [Adding a New System Call](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.4/process/adding-syscalls.html)

In this assignment, you will be coding in both user space and kernel space. Since it could take a
long time to recompile and re-run a new kernel, you should code carefully!

## The Array Statistics Syscall

First, add a new system call that computes some basic statistics (max, min, sum) on an array of
data. In practice, it makes little sense to have this as a syscall; but it allows you to become
familiar with accessing memory between user and kernel space before solving more complex and real
problems that involve the interaction between kernel and user space.

### Specifications

In the kernel's `cmpt300` directory, create a file named `array_stats.h` with the following
contents:

```
// Define the array_stats struct for the array_stats syscall.
#ifndef _ARRAY_STATS_H_
#define _ARRAY_STATS_H_

struct array_stats {
  long min;
  long max;
  long sum;
};

#endif
```

Then create a new syscall named `array_stats` (function `sys_array_stats()`):

* Implement it in your kernel's `cmpt300` directory in a file named `array_stats.c`, using your
  previously defined `array_stats.h` header file: `#include "array_stats.h"`.
* Assign syscall number 437 to the new syscall (in `syscall_64.tbl`).
* The syscall's signature should be:

  ```
  asmlinkage long sys_array_stats(struct array_stats *stats, long *data, long size);
  ```

  * `stats`: A pointer to one `array_stats` structure allocated by the user-space application.
      Structure will be written to by the syscall to store the minimum, maximum, and sum of all
      values in the array pointed to by data.  
  * `data`: An array of `long int` values passed in by the user-space application.  
  * `size`: The number of elements in data. Must be greater than 0.

The `array_stats` syscall must:

* Set the three fields of the stats structure based on the data array. The values in data are signed
  (positive or negative). Nothing special need be done if the sum of all the data
  overflows/underflows a `long`.
* Return 0 when successful.
* Return `-EINVAL` if size <= 0.
* Return `-EFAULT` if there is any error accessing stats or data.
* **Not** allocate or use a large amount of kernel memory to copy the entire input data array from
  user space.

### Hints

**Debugging:** You can use `printk()` in the kernel to print out debug information. You may leave
some of these `printk()` messages in your solution as these messages are not technically displayed
by the user-space application. The messages you leave in should be helpful such as showing
parameters values or errors it caught; they should **not** be of the sort "running line 17" or "past
loop 1." It is usually useful to `printk()` the parameters you are given, and `printk()` any error
conditions you handle.

**Memory access:** Correct memory access is the hardest part of writing this syscall:

* The kernel cannot trust anything it is given by a user-level application. Each pointer, for
  example, could be: (a) perfectly fine, (b) `null`, (c) outside of the user program's memory space,
  or (d) pointing to too small an area of memory. Since the kernel can read/write to any part of
  memory, it would be very dangerous for the kernel to trust a user-level pointer.
* Each read you do using a pointer passed in as input (a user-level pointer) should be done via the
  `copy_from_user(to, from, n)` macro (defined in `include/linux/uaccess.h`. This macro safely
  copies data from a user-level pointer to a kernel-level variable: if there's a problem reading or
  writing the memory, it stops and returns non-zero without crashing the kernel.
* First use this macro to copy values into local variables (which are in the kernel's memory space).
  Then, use these local variables in your program. The aforementioned "Unreliable Guide" provides
  information about the macros.
* You can create a local variable of type `long` inside your syscall function. Use
  `copy_from_user()` to copy one value at a time from the user's data array into this variable. If a
  copy fails (`copy_from_user()` returns non-zero) then have your syscall end immediately and return
  `-EFAULT`.
* Remember to double check that you only ever access the data array using `copy_from_user()`!
* Note that you **can** directly access size because it is passed by value so there is no possible
  problem access memory.
* Likewise, when writing to a user-level pointer, use `copy_to_user(to, from, n)` which checks the
  pointer is valid (non-null), inside the user-program's memory space, and is writable (vs
  read-only). You can create a local variable of type `struct array_stats` inside your syscall
  function. Compute the correct values in this struct first, then at the very end use
  `copy_to_user()` to copy the contents to user's pointer.

**Compilation:** The kernel is compiled with the C90 standard; you must declare your variables at
the start of a block (such as your function) instead of in the middle of your function.

**User-space tests:** A user-space test program is available under the [`tests`
directory](tests/array_stats_test.c) to test your system call. You need to correctly provide
`array_stats.h`. Your code will be marked based on passing these tests and other extra ones that we
use for grading. You may want to run the tests one at a time by commenting out calls in **main()**.

## The Process Ancestors Syscall

In this section, you will implement a syscall which returns information about the current process,
plus its ancestors (its parent process, it's grandparent process, and so on).

### Requirements

In the kernel's `cmpt300` directory, create a file named `process_ancestors.h` with the following
contents:

```
// Structure to hold values returned by process_ancestors sys-call
#ifndef _PROCESS_ANCESTORS_H
#define _PROCESS_ANCESTORS_H

#define ANCESTOR_NAME_LEN 16
struct process_info {
 long pid;                     /* Process ID */
 char name[ANCESTOR_NAME_LEN]; /* Program name of process */
 long state;                   /* Current process state */
 long uid;                     /* User ID of process owner */
 long nvcsw;                   /* # of voluntary context switches */
 long nivcsw;                  /* # of involuntary context switches */
 long num_children;            /* # of children processes */
 long num_siblings;            /* # of sibling processes */
};

#endif
```

Then create new syscall named `process_ancestors` (function `sys_process_ancestors()`):

* Implement it in your kernel's `cmpt300` directory in a file named `process_ancestors.c`, using
  your previously defined header file: `#include "process_ancestors.h"`.
* Assign syscall number 438 to the new syscall (in `syscall_64.tbl`).
* The syscall's signature should be:

  ```
  asmlinkage long sys_process_ancestors(struct process_info *info_array,
                                        long size,
                                        long *num_filled)
  ```

  * `info_array`: An array of `process_info` structs that will be written to by the kernel as it
    fills in information from the current process on up through its ancestors.  
  * `size`: : The number of structs in `info_array`. This is the maximum number of structs that the
    kernel will write into the array (starting with the current process as the first entry and
    working up from there). The size may be larger or smaller than the actual number of ancestors of
    the current process: larger means some entries are left unused (see `num_filled`); smaller means
    information about some processes not written into the array.  
  * `num_filled`: A pointer to a `long` integer. To this location the kernel will store the number
    of structs (in `info_array`) which are written by the kernel. May be less than size if the
    number of ancestors for the current process is less than size.

The `process_ancestors` syscall must:

* Starting at the current process, fill the elements in `info_array` with the correct values.
* Ordering: the current process's information goes into `info_array[0]`; the parent of the current
  process into `info_array[1]`; grandparent into `info_array[2]` and so on.
* Extra structs in `info_array` are left unmodified.
* Return 0 when successful.
* Returns `-EINVAL` if size <= 0.
* Returns `-EFAULT` if any problems access `info_array` or `num_filled`.
* You must not allocate or use a large amount of kernel memory to copy/store large arrays into.

Finally, create a user-space test program which calls your syscall and exercises its functionality,
i.e., testing is your responsibility. You must write many test cases to make sure it works
correctly, and that it generates correct error values for failure conditions (bad pointers, ...).
You can use asserts in your test code to test results and conditions. We will have an extensive test
suit to exercise your solution. Make sure you put this program in the `tests` directory and submit
everything necessary from there according to the [submission requirements](#submission) (so read the
submission requirements carefully as well).

### Hints

**Data structure:** You will make extensive use of the kernel's `task_struct` structures: each
process has a `task_struct`. You can find the `task_struct` for the current process using the macro
current. For example, the PID for the currently running process on this CPU can be found with: `long
pid = current->pid;`.

**Basic algorithm sketch:** (1) Start from the current process and fill in fields for
`info_array[0]`. (2) Move to the parent of this process (`current->parent`), and copy its info into
`info_array[1]`. (3) Repeat until the parent of the process you are working on is itself
(`cur_task->parent == cur_task`).

* The first task spawned by Linux is its own parent, so its parent pointer points to itself. This
  process has PID 0 and is the idle task (named swapper).
* We recommend to first get the info on the current process and print it to the screen (using
  `printk`) to ensure you have the correct values. Then you can work on getting the data into the
  `process_info` structs and handling ancestors.

**Notes on the fields of `process_info`**:

* Quite a few of the values can be pulled directly out of the `task_struct` structure. Look for
  fields with a matching name. `task_struct` is defined in `include/linux/sched.h` (in your kernel
  source code directory). To include this in your syscall implementation use: `#include`.
  [Here](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.109/source/include/linux/sched.h) is a good online
  site to navigate the kernel source.
* The name of the program for a process is stored in the `task_struct.comm` field.
* The user ID for the owner of a process can be found inside the process's credentials (`cred`
  field). Inside `cred`, you want to look at the `uid` field.
* For counting the number of children and siblings, you'll want to start with the following linked
  list nodes: `task_struct.children`, and `task_struct.sibling`.
  * These are nodes in circular linked lists. Linux uses the `struct list_head` for a node because
    in a circular linked list, each node can be thought of as the head of the list.
  * You can follow the next field of a node in the list (a `list_head`) to get the node
    (`list_head`) of the next element in the list.
  * It is a circular linked list, so you'll have to determine how to count the number of elements
    (think of how you know when to stop following next pointers). Hint: Think of addresses.
  * Note that Linux has some clever (complicated) ways of taking a node in the list (which just has
    a `next` and `prev` field pointing to other `list_head` structures) and accessing the full
    structure that contains the node. For example, given a `list_head` struct that is in a
    `task_struct`, the kernel includes macros to give you the full `task_struct`! However, you have
    (mercifully) been spared having to do this. If you are interested, for fun try printing out the
    PID of each of the sibling processes.
* Safe memory access is critical. Apply all the suggestions from the previous syscall for safe
  memory access.
* You can use the `ps` command in your QEMU virtual machine to display information on running
  processes and verify the syscall output. See `ps`'s man page for how to select the information it
  displays.

## Submission

**Make sure you push your code before the deadline.**

Make sure you push every file/directory that you want to submit, which includes the following:

* The `cmpt300` directory in your kernel source code, the `Makefile` and `syscall_64.tbl` file.
* The `tests` directory that should contain all your user mode code. This directory should include a
  `Makefile` that compiles your code and statically links everything as described in [Custom Kernel
  Guide](CUSTOM_KERNEL_GUIDE.md).

If you did this assignment in a group, include also a file named `GROUP.md` in your repo root
directory that details each group member's contributions; each of you should contribute to a
reasonable share of the assignment, and every group member will receive the same marks. Please
remember that all submissions will automatically be compared for unexplainable similarities.

## Grading Policies

Make sure you are familiar with the course policies. Especially, we do not accept late submissions,
so please submit on time by the deadline.

Your code must compile and run on Linux; **you will receive a 0 if your code does not compile.**
Sample solutions will **not** be provided for assignments.
