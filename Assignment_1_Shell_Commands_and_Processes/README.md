# CMPT 300 Assignment 1: Shell Commands and Processes

**Total points**: 100 + 15 bonus  

**Overall percentage**: 12% + 1.8% bonus  

**Due**: Mon Feb 6, 23:59:59 PT

This assignment may be completed individually or in a group (up to three people). Everyone in the
same team receives the same grade.

## Grouping

You can do the assignment as a group of up to 3 people if you'd like.Â If you do, make sure that
everyone joins the same team on GitHub Classroom. When you accept the invite for this assignment,
you can create a team if no one else in your team has created a team, or join an existing team.

## Git with Your Team

When you collaborate with others with Git, it is best to communicate with each other frequently in
order to avoid conflicts. For example, if you and your teammate edit the same part of the code and
push it to the remote GitHub repo, it will create a conflict. Cases like this require manual
merging, which is often difficult to get right. Thus, it is best to communicate with each other and
know which parts of the code others are working on.

Also, make sure you frequently pull the latest updates from your remote GitHub repo by running `git
pull`. Frequently doing this is very important.

## Resources

* Sample code: [shell.c](./shell.c), [Makefile](./Makefile)
* [Guide to Signals](./GuideToSignals.pdf)

## Overview

In this assignment, you will develop a simple Linux shell. The shell accepts user commands and then
executes each command in a separate process. The shell provides the user a prompt at which the next
command is entered. One technique for implementing a shell interface is to have the parent process
first read what the user enters on the command line and then create a separate child process that
performs the command. Unless otherwise specified, the parent process waits for the child to exit
before continuing. However, UNIX shells typically also allow the child process to run in the
background or concurrently by specifying the ampersand (`&`) at the end of the command. The separate
child process is created using the `fork()` system call and the user's command is executed by using
one of the system calls in the `exec()` family.

All code **must** be written in C and run on a Linux machine. We will grade your code on a Linux
machine. You should create a directory for this assignment, such as `~/cmpt300/a1/` and put all
files related to this assignment in it.

## A Simple Shell

A C program that provides the basic operation of a command line shell is given below. The `main()`
function first calls `read_command()`, which reads a full command from the user and tokenizes it
into separate words (arguments). These tokens can be passed directly to `execvp()` in the child
process. If the user enters an `&` as the final argument, `read_command()` will set the
`in_background` parameter to true (and remove the `&` from the array of tokens). For example, if the
user enters `ls -l` at the `$` prompt, `tokens[0]` will contain `ls`, `tokens[1]` will contain (or
point to) the string `-l`, and `tokens[2]` will be a `NULL` pointer indicating the end of the
arguments. (Each of these strings is a `NULL` terminated C-style string). Note that the character
array `buff` will contain the text that the user entered; however, it will not be one single `NULL`
terminated string but rather a bunch of `NULL` terminated strings, each of which is a token pointed
to by the `tokens` array.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define COMMAND_LENGTH 1024
#define NUM_TOKENS (COMMAND_LENGTH / 2 + 1)

/**
 * Read a command from the keyboard into the buffer 'buff' and tokenize it
 * such that 'tokens[i]' points into 'buff' to the i'th token in the command.
 * buff: Buffer allocated by the calling code. Must be at least
 *       COMMAND_LENGTH bytes long.
 * tokens[]: Array of character pointers which point into 'buff'. Must be at
 *       least NUM_TOKENS long. Will strip out up to one final '&' token.
 *       'tokens' will be NULL terminated.
 * in_background: pointer to a boolean variable. Set to true if user entered
 *       an & as their last token; otherwise set to false.
 */
void read_command(char *buff, char *tokens[], _Bool *in_background)
{
	// ... Full code available in shell.c...
}

/**
 * Main and Execute Commands
 */
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	char input_buffer[COMMAND_LENGTH];
	char *tokens[NUM_TOKENS];
	while (true) {
		// Get command
		// Use write because we need to use read()/write() to work with
		// signals, and they are incompatible with printf().
		write(STDOUT_FILENO, "$ ", strlen("$ "));
		_Bool in_background = false;
		read_command(input_buffer, tokens, &in_background);

		/**
		 * Steps For Basic Shell:
		 * 1. Fork a child process
		 * 2. Child process invokes execvp() using results in token array.
		 * 3. If in_background is false, parent waits for
		 *    child to finish. Otherwise, parent loops back to
		 *    read_command() again immediately.
		 */
	}
	return 0;
}
```

## Problems

There are three mandatory problems (100 points) that you will need to solve:  

* Create the child process and executing the command in the child.
* Implement some internal commands.
* Implement a history feature.

There is also one optional problem for a 15-point bonus, but you must attempt the mandatory problems
first, before attempting the bonus problem. Attempting the bonus problem without work done in the
mandatory problems will not get you any points for the bonus problem.

### Problem 1. Creating Child Process [24 points]

First, modify `main()` so that upon returning form `read_command()`, a child is forked and executes
the command specified by the user. As noted above, `read_command()` loads the contents of the
`tokens` array with the command specified by the user. This `tokens` array will be passed to the
`execvp()` function, which has the following interface:

```
execvp(char *command, char * params[]); 
```

Here `command` represents the command to be performed and `params` stores the parameters to this
command. For this project, the `execvp()` function should be invoked as

```
execvp(tokens[0], tokens); 
```

Be sure to check the value of `in_background` to determine if the parent process is to wait for the
child exit or not. Hint: use `waitpid()` instead of `wait()` because you want to wait on the child
you just launched. If you only use `wait()` and have previously launched any child processes in the
background that have terminated, `wait()` will immediately return having "consumed" the previous
zombie process, and your current process will incorrectly act as though it was run in the
background. Note that we won't be testing with interactive command-line processes run in the
background (think `vim`), or test using signals while running a command in the background. If
`execvp()` returns an error (see `man execvp`) then display an error message. Note that using
`printf()` may not work well for this assignment and that you should use `write()` instead (look up
more with `man write`). The issue is that we need to use the `read()` function for getting the
user's command and use `write()` when working with signals (later). And, it turns out that
`printf()` and `read()/write()` don't always work well together. Therefore, when printing to the
screen, use the `write()` command. For common things, such as displaying a simple string, or writing
a number to the screen, you may want to make your own functions which make it easier. You can
convert an integer to a string using `sprintf()`.

**Note:** When a process in Linux finishes, it still exists in the kernel with some status
information until the parent process waits on that child. These un-waited-on terminated child
processes are known zombies. For this assignment, you won't lose any points if you don't correctly
`wait()` on zombie processes from background tasks; however, it's a good habit to correctly cleanup
the zombies on your system. We have suggested above that you use `waitpid()` to wait on the correct
child. However, this will leave any background process as zombie processes, i.e., after terminating,
the parent process will never `wait()` on the child. You can correct this by occasionally trying a
non-blocking wait to handle any zombie child processes. We can pass the `WNOHANG` option to
`waitpid()` to be non-blocking, and setting the PID to -1 will wait on any child process. For
example, have the following code run after every user command is processed:

```
// Cleanup any previously exited background child processes
// (The zombies)
while (waitpid(-1, NULL, WNOHANG) > 0)
	; // do nothing.
```

### Problem 2. Shell Prompt and Internal Commands [24 points]

First, make sure your shell prompt always shows the current working directory. For example, if in
the `/home/cmpt300` folder, the prompt should be:

```
/home/cmpt300$
```

Next, implement some internal commands. Internal commands are built-in features of the shell itself,
as opposed to a separate program that is executed. Implement the commands listed below. Note that
for these you need not fork a new process as they can be handled directly in the parent process. All
the commands here are **case-sensitive**.

* `exit`: Exit the shell program. If the user provided any argument, abort the operation (i.e.,
  command not executed) and display an error message.
* `pwd`: Display the current working directory. Use the `getcwd()` function. Run `man getcwd` for
  more. Again, abort the operation and display an error message if the user provided any argument.
* `cd`: Change the current working directory. Use the `chdir()` function. Pass `chdir()` the first
  argument the user enters (it will accept absolute and relative paths). If the user passed in more
  than one argument, abort the operation and display an error message. If `chdir()` returns an
  error, display an error message.
* `help`: Display help information on internal commands.
    * If the first argument is one of our internal commands, print `<argument> is a builtin command`
      plus a brief description on what the command does. For example, if argument is `cd`, the
      output should be:
        
        ```
        'cd' is a builtin command for changing the current working directory.
        ```
        
    * If the first argument is not an internal command, this command prints `<argument> is an
      external command or application`. For example, if argument is `ls`, the output must be:
        
        ```
        'ls' is an external command or application
        ```
        
    * If there is more than one argument, display an error message.
    * If there is no argument provided, list all the supported internal commands. For each command,
      include a short summary on what it does.

### Problem 3. History Feature [32 points]

The next task is to modify your shell to provide a history feature that allows the user access up to
the 10 most recently entered commands. Start numbering the user's commands at 0 and increment for
each command entered. These numbers will grow past 9. For example, if the user has entered 35
commands, then the most recent 10 will be numbered 15 through 34.

**History Commands**: First implement an internal command `history` which displays the 10 most
recent commands executed in the shell. If there are less than 10 commands entered, display all the
commands entered so far.

* Display the commands in descending order (sorted by its command number).
* The output should include both external application commands and internal commands.
* Display the command number on the left, and the command (with all its arguments) on the right.
  * Hint: Print a tab between the two outputs to have them line up easily.
  * If the command is run in the background using `&`, it must be added to the history with the `&`.
* A sample output of the history command is shown below:

```
/home/cmpt300$ history
30	history
29	cd /home/cmpt300
28	cd /proc
27	cat uptime
26	cd /usr
25	ls
24	man pthread_create
23	ls
22	echo "Hello World from my shell!"
21	ls -la
/home/cmpt300$
```

Next, implement the `!` and related commands which allows users to run commands directly from the
history list:

* Command `!n` runs command number n, such as `!22` will re-run the 23rd command entered this
  session. In the above example, this will re-run the echo command.
    * If n is not a number, or an invalid value (not one of the previous 10 command numbers) then
      display an error.
    * You may treat any command starting with `!` as a history command. For example, if the user
      types `!hi`, just display an error. Note that `atoi("hi")` returns 0, which should not be
      treated as a valid command.
* Command `!!` runs the previous command.
    * If there is no previous command, display an error message.
* When running a command using `!n` or `!!`, display the command from history to the screen so the
  user can see what command they are actually running.
* Neither the `!!` nor the `!n` commands are to be added to the history list themselves, but rather
  the command being executed from the history must be added. Here is an example.

```
/home/cmpt300$ echo test
test
/home/cmpt300$ !!
echo test
test
/home/cmpt300$ history
15	history
14	echo test
13	echo test
12	ls
11	man pthread_create
10	cd /home/cmpt300
9	ls
8	ls -la
7	echo Hello World from my shell!
6	history
/home/cmpt300$
```

Suggestions:

* Implement history as a global two dimensional array:
    
    ```
    #define HISTORY_DEPTH 10
    char history[HISTORY_DEPTH][COMMAND_LENGTH];
    ```
    
* Rather than having all your code directly access the history array, write some functions which
  encapsulate accesses to this array. Suggested functions would include: add command to history,
  retrieve command (copy into buffer, likely), printing the last 10 commands to the screen.

**Signals:** Change your shell program to display the help information when the user presses
`ctrl-c` (which is the `SIGINT` signal). A guide on using signals is available
[here](./GuideToSignals.pdf).

* In `main()`, register a custom signal handler for the `SIGINT` signal.
* Have the signal handler display the help information (same as the `help` command).
* Then re-display the command-prompt before returning.
* Note that when another child process is running, `ctrl-c` will likely cancel/kill that process.
  Therefore displaying the help information with `ctrl-c` will only be tested when there are no
  child processes running.

Suggestions:

* To implement this, you will also need to change `read_command()` a little bit.
* The signal handler will do nothing but displaying the help information and then display the prompt
  again. The signal will interrupt the `read()` system call and discard all data already read for
  this command.
* When `read()` fails, it returns -1. You can check why `read` fails: if it returns -1 and the
  environment variable `errno` equals `EINTR` it means that it was interrupted by a signal. If the
  return value is -1 and `errno` is any other value, it means `read` just failed and the program
  should exit.
    * To correctly check `read()`'s return value you can change the code that you now have:
        
    ```
    if (length < 0) {
       perror("Unable to read command. Terminating.\n");
       exit(-1);  \* terminate with error */
    }
    ```
    
    to the following:
    
    ```
    if ((length < 0) && (errno !=EINTR)) {
       perror("Unable to read command. Terminating.\n");
       exit(-1);  \* terminate with error */
    }
    ```

### Problem 4 (Optional). Better `cd` Command [15 bonus points]

**Note**: You must finish Problems 1, 2 and 3 before attempting Problem 4. Submitting Problem 4
alone without solutions to Problems 1, 2 or 3 will leave you with 0 mark for Problem 4.

Implement the following features that are often supported by the `cd` command in modern shells
(e.g., bash).

* Change to the home directory if no argument is provided.
* Support `~` for the home folder. For example, `cd ~/cmpt300` should change to the "cmpt300"
  directory under the current user's home directory. Issuing `cd ~` will switch to the home
  directory.
* Support `-` for changing back to the previous directory. For example, suppose that the current
  working directory is `/home` and you issued `cd /` to change to the root directory. Then, `cd -`
  will switch back to the `/home` directory.

Hints: You may find the [getuid](https://linux.die.net/man/2/getuid) and
[getpwuid](https://linux.die.net/man/3/getpwuid) functions useful. They allow you to gather useful
information about the current user.

## Notes

You do not need to support either `>` or `|` from the terminal. These are features of the normal
Linux terminal that we are not implementing. Your code must not have any memory leaks or memory
access errors (using [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/)). Your shell must free all memory before it
exits. However, your child processes may exit without freeing all their memory (if `exec()` fails
then the child process will have a copy of all the memory that the parent holds; freeing this memory
would be unnecessarily time consuming for the OS). Therefore, you may ignore any Valgrind messages
when a child process terminates to the effect of memory being held when program terminated.

## Submission

**Most importantly, make sure you push your code before the deadline.**

Add, commit, and push frequently to the remote repo. E.g.,

```
$ git pull
$ git add shell.c Makefile
$ git commit -m "your commit message (explain your commit)"
$ git push
```

**Again, make sure you push your code before the deadline.**

We will build your code using your `Makefile`, and run it using the command: `./shell`. You may use
more than one .c/.h file in your solution if you like. If so, your `Makefile` must correctly build
your project. Please remember that all submissions will automatically be compared for unexplainable
similarities.

## Grading Policies

Make sure you are familiar with the course policies. Especially, we do not accept late submissions,
so please submit on time by the deadline.  

Your code must compile and run on Linux; **you will receive a 0 if your code does not compile.**
Sample solutions will **not** be provided for assignments. Your code should also not leak any
memory; we will check using Valgrind. Any memory leak will lead to -10 points. We will test your
code using more complex and hidden test cases, so you are encouraged to vary as many parameters as
possible to test your code.

## Grading Distribution

* [24 points] Creating Child Process
* [24 points] Shell Prompt and Internal Commands
* [32 points] History Feature
* [10 points] Correct memory usage (checked by Valgrind)
* [10 points] Good code quality
* [15 bonus points] Better `cd` Command

Code that does not compile gets a 0.

Everyone in the same team receives the same grade.

For code quality, make sure you follow a style guide such as [LLVM Coding
Standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html), [Google C++ Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), [Mozilla C++ Coding
Style](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/code-quality/coding-style/coding_style_cpp.html),
etc. If you are using VS Code, you can install C/C++ Extension Pack and choose a code formatter that
can automatically format your code upon saving. Other IDEs have similar plug-ins as well, so make
sure you use those.
